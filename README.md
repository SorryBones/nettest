Small program to send chat messages over a network using peer-2-peer connection.
WARNING: This program uses your local IP to connect a client. Only share this information with someone you already trust.

How to use:
1) The host runs the "host.py" script.
2) The host shares their local IP, which is displayed on screen at startup, with their trusted client.
3) The client enters the host's IP, which they are prompted for at startup.
4) The host and client take turns sending messages to each other, with the host going first.
5) The host or client can end the session at anytime by entering: "!DISCONNECT"
